**biurad/php-annotations** is an annotations and attribute reader for [PHP] 7.2+ created by [Divine Niiquaye][@divineniiquaye]. This library provides a Simple, Lazy, Fast & Lightweight [Doctrine Annotations][doctrine] and PHP 8 Attribute reader for your project.

## 📦 Installation & Basic Usage

This project requires [PHP] 7.2 or higher. The recommended way to install, is via [Composer]. Simply run:

```bash
$ composer require biurad/annotations
```

We all know writing annotations support for a project takes alot of time, work and sometimes end up changing the whole code to suite the current changes of [PHP], example of project that has messy annotations is [Nette DI][nette-di]. In short, this library is meant to be a base building block that utilizes [Doctrine Annotations][doctrine] and attributes introduced in [PHP] 8.

Let's you working on a few projects and you need to annotation support for each. With this library we make your work easier,all you need is a instance of `Biurad\Annotations\ListenerInterface` and an annotated class for finding annotations or attributes.

**To know more about how to use this library, try going through the `tests` directory and find out how to integrate this library into your project.**

example of usage:

```php
use Biurad\Annotations\AnnotationLoader;
use Doctrine\Common\Annotations\AnnotationReader;

$annotation = new AnnotationLoader(new AnnotationReader());

$annotation->attachListener(...); // Add your implemented Annotation listeners

$annotation->attach(...); // Add a class string, classless file, or directory

$listeners = \iterator_to_array($annotation->load());

// To use a collector you implemented into your instance of `Biurad\Annotations\ListenerInterface`
foreach ($$listeners as $collector) {
    // You can fetch the required $collector from here.
}
```
